# Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

I used descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. My goal is to give my readers a good intuition for the data and used statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

# Questions for Investigation:
1. What is the independent and dependent variable?
2. What is an appropriate null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis?
3. What statistical test was performed?
4. Report some descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation and others.
5. Provide visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data.
6. Perform statistical test and report results
